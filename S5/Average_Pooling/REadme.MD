Target: Added Average pooling Layer after adding Dropouts and  BatchNormalization in each layer where ever required

Results: Parameters:9.122K Best Train Accuracy: 98.05 Best Test Accuracy: 99.40 (13th Epoch), 99.32 (14th Epoch)

Analysis: Underfitting is Observed as the train accuracy is less then test accuracy, though test accuracy values have increased.
