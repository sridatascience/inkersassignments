Target:
Added BatchNormalization After Relu

Results:
Parameters:9.922K
Best Train Accuracy: 99.66
Best Test Accuracy: 99.33 (8th Epoch), 99.28 (14th Epoch)

Analysis:
Overfitting is Observed may be we can achieve 99.4% accuracy with more number of EPOCHS,
but the goal was to achieve in less then or equal to 15 EPOCHS
